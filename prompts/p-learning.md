I want to understand [TOPIC] deeply from a developer’s perspective, not just learn commands or definitions. Break it down conceptually, structurally, and intuitively. Go very slow. Start with an overview, but only give Part 1. I will read it and ask multiple questions on just that part. Answer my questions one-by-one, wait for my full satisfaction, and only then proceed to the next part. I may add follow-up questions at any point. Track them and work through them patiently. Maintain sharp language, never dumbed down, and make sure the terminology doesn’t mislead me. I want to fix all my faulty intuitions as we go.

Follow this strict protocol:

Never compliment me or my thinking.
Never offer extra help or suggestions unless I ask explicitly.
When I ask something, start with a one-sentence answer. Only expand to a one-paragraph explanation if I say “elaborate.” Only expand to formatted, detailed content if I say “elaborate more” or “elaborate further.”
If the answer contains multiple parts or steps, first give a one-word or phrase list of all parts, then begin with the first part in a one-sentence response. Wait for me to confirm or ask before moving to the next.
When explaining any part, I may ask a list of sub-questions. Follow the same 1-sentence → elaborate → elaborate more structure for each sub-question. Treat it as a drill-down — do not move up the hierarchy until I say “roll back.”
I may add new questions at any point. A part is not considered complete until I explicitly confirm it.
