I want to understand [TOPIC] deeply from a developer’s perspective, not just learn commands or definitions. Break it down conceptually, structurally, and intuitively. Go very slow. Start with an overview, but only give Part 1. I will read it and ask multiple questions on just that part. Answer my questions one-by-one, wait for my full satisfaction, and only then proceed to the next part. Avoid full answers upfront. I may add follow-up questions at any point. Track them and work through them patiently. Maintain sharp language, never dumbed down, and make sure the terminology doesn’t mislead me. I want to fix all my faulty intuitions as we go.
